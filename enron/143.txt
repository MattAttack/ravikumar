Dear Mr Geil

Paul Hennemeyer has asked me to schedule some time for him to meet with
you and Brendan Devlin next week.

By any chance, are you available on either:

* the morning of Monday 8 October or
* on Friday 12 October?

I would be grateful if you would please let me know.

Thank you and regards
Amber Keenan

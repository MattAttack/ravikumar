Soussan,

Thanks for your message. It would be great to meet you when you come to
Houston.
 I shall be in town on December 7,  flying back from Philly in the morning.
Assuming that the flight is on schedule, I shall be available for dinner.
Please, let me know how I can contact you on Thursday, December the 7th,
to confirm.

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince
